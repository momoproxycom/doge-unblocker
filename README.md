# Doge Proxy (Unblocker V4): The Secret Weapon for Bypassing School Firewalls (And How It Works)


<h2>What is Doge Proxy?</h2>
                    <p><a hef="https://momoproxy.com/blog/doge-proxy">"Doge Proxy"</a> is a browser-based web proxy service, more commonly known by its variant names Doge Unblocker, Doge Unblocker V4/V5, or simply "Doge Proxy links." It is designed to help users bypass network restrictions in controlled environments like schools, workplaces, or public WiFi.</p>

                    <h2>Core Functionality</h2>
                    <p>At its core, Doge Unblocker is a web proxy—a service that acts as an intermediary between a user's browser and the internet.</p>
                    <h3>How It Works:</h3>
                        <li>You send a request to visit a site to the Doge server.</li>
                        <li>The Doge server fetches the content from the target website.</li>
                        <li>The server then forwards that content back to your browser.</li>

                   Because all traffic is routed through the proxy, network filters only see a connection to the proxy itself, not the final destination. Unlike a full VPN, it only handles browser traffic within a specific tab or session.
                    
                    As an open-source project on GitHub, Doge Unblocker is described as a "site unblocker" powered by Ultraviolet, claiming to allow access to blocked sites without saving browsing history.

                    <h3>Key Points:</h3>

                        <li><strong>Link Rotation:</strong> Because network admins frequently block known proxy domains, users rely on constantly updated lists of "working links"</li>
                    </ul>
